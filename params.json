It's a small project that I plan to work on little by little, so there's no release date yet ^^;\r\n\r\nThis project is a work built on the original [Litewrite code](http://litewrite.net/) made by [Jan-Christoph Borchardt](http://jancborchardt.net/) & [Jorin Vogel](http://jorin-vogel.com/)\r\n\r\nInspired by [iA Writer](http://iawriter.com) & [LightWrite](http://gun.io/w).
