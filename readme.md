#[Litewrite Chrome App]
unobtrusive writing ported as a Chrome native app by [Alex Neri](http://alexneri.co)

Seeing as this is an app that wonderfully does its job as a writing tool, I believe that it can be used as a native desktop app, though the use of the [Chrome App framework](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps). It's a small project that I plan to work on little by little, so there's no release date yet ^^;

This project is a work built on the original [Litewrite code](http://litewrite.net/) made by [Jan-Christoph Borchardt](http://jancborchardt.net/) & [Jorin Vogel](http://jorin-vogel.com/)

Inspired by [iA Writer](http://iawriter.com) & [LightWrite](http://gun.io/w). Initial prototype built on [Notes](http://nv.github.com/notes). [Alegreya](http://www.huertatipografica.com.ar/tipografias/alegreya/ejemplos.html) typeface by Juan Pablo del Peral


## Remotestorage

This is an [unhosted web app](http://unhosted.org), meaning its code is fully client-side, without any server backend you need to trust! It also supports the open [remotestorage](http://remotestorage.io) protocol so you can sync your data across devices & browsers.
